Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Atlan â€” a backend & game developer with a passion for innovative technologies. I love a good problem-solving challenge to bring such innovations to life in the most efficient way possible.

I'm very adaptable and able to thrive in solo as well as group development environments.

I speak English but also type in the following languages:
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Lua

In addition to languages, I also have the following technical skills...
* Node.js
* REST APIs with Express
* SQL & NoSQL databases - MySQL, MongoDB (plus Redis caching)
* Designing & programming .NET WinForms apps
* DevOps

I'm very open to learning new technologies so these lists will expand with time :)
