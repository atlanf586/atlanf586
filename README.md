Hello, World! 👋 I'm Atlan. I'm a backend & game developer with a passion for innovative technologies. I love a good problem-solving challenge to make such technologies possible and to implement them in the most efficient way possible.

I speak English but also type in the following languages:
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Lua

Nothing annoys me more than unorganised code; clean code is good code, there are no two ways about it.

I'm very adaptable and able to thrive in solo as well as group development environments.

In addition to languages, I also have the following technical skills...
* Node.js
* REST APIs with Express
* SQL & NoSQL databases - MySQL, MongoDB (plus Redis caching)
* Designing & programming .NET WinForm apps
* DevOps

I'm also very open to learning new technologies, these lists will expand with time :)
