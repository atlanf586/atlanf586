Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Atlan. I specialise in backend development but I also like to do some game development in my pasttime. I have a passion for novel and niche products and coming up with solutions to the challenges they pose when bringing them to fruition.

I talk to humans in English and communicate with computers in...

* C#

In addition to languages, I also posess the following technical skills, to name a few:
* Node.js
* REST APIs with Express
* SQL & NoSQL databases - MySQL, MongoDB (plus Redis caching)
* .NET WinForms apps
* DevOps

I'm always keen to learn new technologies so these lists will expand with time :)
